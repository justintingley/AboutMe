			<h2>The man, the myth, the legend</h2>

			<p>By the Act of March 1, 1872, Congress established Yellowstone National Park in the Territories of Montana and Wyoming
				<em>"as a public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people"</em> and placed it "under exclusive control of the Secretary of the Interior." <strong>The founding of Yellowstone National Park began a worldwide national park movement.</strong> Today more than 100 nations contain some 1,200 national parks or equivalent preserves.</p>

		<p>In the years following the establishment of Yellowstone, the United States authorized additional national parks and monuments, many of them carved from the federal lands of the West. These, also, were administered by the Department of the Interior, while other monuments and natural and historical areas were administered by the War Department and the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture. No single agency provided unified management of the varied federal parklands.</p>


		<p>The three oldest US national parks are:</p>
		  <ol>
			<li>Yellowstone - 1872</li>
			<li>Yosemite - 1890</li>
			<li>Rocky Mountain - 1915</li>
		  </ol>


		<p>The most visited parks are:</p>
		  <ul>
			<li>The Great Smoky Mountains</li>
			<li>Yellowstone</li>
			<li>Zion</li>
		  </ul>
